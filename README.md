Modelling of data in topics. As input data, papers from the NIPS (Neural
Information Processing Systems) conference will be used. NIPS is a machine learning conference.
Data can be downloaded from here:

It is consisted from the following tasks:

• Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Basic text processing methods such as
tokenisation, stop word removal, stemming and vectorising text via term frequencies (TF) as well as
the inverse document frequencies (TF-IDF)

• Topic Modelling with LDA  – Experimenting with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
Experiment with the different parameters (number of topics, alpha parameter, etc.). Explore the
dataset by finding for example the most representative document for each topic and the topic
distribution across documents.
